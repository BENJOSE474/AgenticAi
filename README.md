# 🤖 AgenticAI

AgenticAI is a research and experimentation repository focused on **Agentic Workflows**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Multi-Agent Systems**.  
It provides hands-on notebooks and examples to explore adaptive RAG, corrective strategies, evaluation methods, and memory-augmented agents.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔄 **Adaptive RAG** — experimenting with flexible retrieval pipelines
- ✅ **Corrective RAG** — improving reliability of generated responses
- 🤝 **Multi-Agent Systems** — exploring collaboration between multiple agents
- 🧠 **RAG Memory** — integrating short-term and long-term memory into agent workflows
- 📊 **RAG Evaluation** — benchmarking and validating RAG pipelines
- 📓 Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step experimentation
